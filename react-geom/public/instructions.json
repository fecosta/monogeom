A higher value (colored in purple) is associated with less equality of opportunities, while a lower value (colored in yellow) is associated with greater equality of opportunities. The country with the highest Absolute IOp level is South Africa (0.47), while European countries like Sweden (0.09) or Poland (0.08) are characterized by more opportunities for all.</p>",
  "chart": "<p>This graph illustrates the time evolution of inequality of opportunity (IOp) across a selected set of countries. For example, Australia estimates consistently show low IOp levels between 2005 and 2019, at around 0.1 Gini points. IOp in Peru is high and stable at around 0.3 Gini points until 2007, then descends to 0.25 between 2008 and 2012, before rising back to 0.26 in 2015.</p>",
  "table": "<p>We present our estimates of Total Sample inequality, Ex-Ante IOp, and Ex-Post IOp in a tabular format.</p><p>You can customize the table by selecting your preferred index (Gini or MLD) and choosing between Absolute or Relative measures of IOp. Additionally, you have the option to filter countries by region and select whether to display only the latest estimate or all available values.</p><p>For each year we specify whether IOp has been measured using income or consumption.</p><p>For example, in Argentina (2014), the total sample income inequality reaches 0.38 Gini points, the Ex-Ante Absolute Inequality of Opportunity reaches 0.179 Gini points, and the Ex-Post Absolute Inequality of Opportunity reaches 0.177 Gini points.</p>",
  "ante": "<p>The Ex-Ante tree represents the partition of the population into groups or types, according to the association between the average outcome (income or consumption) and the circumstances, and is used to estimate Ex-Ante IOp. Ex-Ante Trees read top-to-bottom. By navigating along each branch of the tree you can fully define the characteristics of individuals belonging to each type. Types are shown as gray squares at the bottom of the tree structure.</p><p>For each Type we provide the \"Population Share\" of individuals within it, along with the ratio of its average income to the sample mean income. Here, a \"Relative Type Mean\" below 1 indicates a group facing relative disadvantage, with the most disadvantaged group having the lowest value. Opposed, a \"Relative Type Mean\" over 1 indicates a group facing relative advantage, with the most advantaged group having the highest value.</p><p>In the case of Argentina 2014 (default), the first split divides the population into those born in areas 1 and 5, and those born in areas 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. The splitting process continues using other circumstances and categories, until the final Type partition (in grey boxes) is reached. In this case, Type 17 defines the worst-off type, formed with a combination of Birth Area (3,4,6) and Mother Education (0,1,2,3,4,5,6) representing 15.92% of the population, and receiving 58.7% of the sample mean income. Opposed, Type 10 is the best-off type, formed by those born in Birth Area 5, and Father Education 10, 12, 13 and 15, representing 1.3% of the population and receiving 193% of the sample mean income.</p><p>The Ex-Ante Shapley value decomposition shows the relative contribution of each circumstance to the Ex-Ante IOp estimate. For example, in Argentina 2014, Birth Area contributes around 34% to the IOp, with Father Occupation, Father Education and Mother Education contributing around 19%, 23% and 21%, respectively.</p>",
  "post": "<p>The Ex-Post tree represents the partition of the population into various groups or types, according to the association between the distribution of the outcome (income or consumption) and the circumstances, and is used to estimate Ex-Post IOp. Ex-Post Trees read left-to-right. By navigating along each branch of the tree, you can fully define the characteristics of individuals belonging to each type. The red graphs at the extreme right of the Ex-Post tree show the income distribution within each type. You will notice that they have different shapes, meaning that income is distributed differently within the type.</p><p>For each Type we also provide the “Population Share” of individuals within it, along with the ratio of its average income to the sample mean income. Here, a “Relative Type Mean” below 1 indicates a group facing relative disadvantage, with the most disadvantaged group having the lowest value. Opposed, a “Relative Type Mean” over 1 indicates a group facing relative advantage, with the most advantaged group having the highest value.</p><p>In the case of Argentina 2014, the first split divides the population into those born in areas 1 and 5, and those born in areas 2, 3, 4, 6, 7. The splitting process continues using other circumstances and categories, until the final Type partition (the list of red density distributions) is reached. In this case, the Type with smallest relative income is Type 21, that accounts for 9.12% of the population and have, on average, 58% of the sample income.</p>",

  "alluvial": "<p>Ex-Ante and Ex-Post trees explore distinct approaches to IOp, so their grouping of individuals into Types may differ. The alluvial diagram represents the flows of individuals from the Type partition in the Ex-Ante tree to the Type partition in the Ex-Post tree.

Conversely, most of the worse-off individuals in the Ex-Post tree (Type 21) are also worse-off in the Ex-Ante one (Type 17), with some of them also belonging to Type 18 in the Ex-Ante approach.</p>"
